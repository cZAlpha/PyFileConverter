TO DO:

 - Optional: Make a loading screen to occupy the user while the program processes the files

 - Add a completed screen that pops up after the user converts their imported files and has a clear/back button that goes back to the main menu
        - Ensure that the completed screen shows the original filename and extensions as well as the new ones

- Add .heic to other filetypes to the application

- Add compatibility for video files of several types: .mov, .mp4, .mp3
