TO DO

1. Fix error with delete buttons not being instantiated at the right (x,y) location due to moving the window after the application is instantiated

2. Fix the back button on the settings menu not working, god only knows why it won't lmao

3. Actually add buttons to change the filetype

4. Add a button to start converting

5. Optional: Make a loading screen to occupy the user while the program processes the files

6. Add a completed screen that pops up after the user converts their imported files and has a clear/back button that goes back to the main menu
        - Ensure that the completed screen shows the original filename and extensions as well as the new ones
